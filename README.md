# scRNA-seq-Workshop

Welcome to the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) workshop. This workshop will introduce you to the scRNA-seq workflow, which involves data cleaning, cluster visualisation and gene expression analysis.

Part 1 involves visualsing a single dataset, and characterising two clusters based on their gene expression patterns.

Part 2 involves visualising two, integrated datasets, identifying differences between the dataset, and characterising a cluster based on gene expression patterns.
