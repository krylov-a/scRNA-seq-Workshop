# scRNA-seq-Workshop

"Welcome to the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) workshop.This workshop will introduce you to the scRNA-seq workflow, which involves data cleaning, visualisation and analysis.

Part 1 involves visualsing a single dataset, and characterising two clusters based on their gene expression patterns.

Part 2 invovles visualising two, integrated datasets, identifying differences between the dataset, and charactersing a cluster based on gene expression patterns."
